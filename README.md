**SGalaxy Classification with Machine Learning**

## Overview
This project classifies galaxies into morphological types: **spiral, elliptical, and irregular**. 
It explores how different **preprocessing techniques** affect model performance and includes **orientation-specific analysis** for research-level insights.

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess galaxy images
- Train CNN and Transfer Learning models for classification
- Study the effect of preprocessing choices on accuracy
- Apply Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) for model interpretability
- Maintain a **clean, reproducible research pipeline**

## Dataset
- Source: [Galaxy Morphology Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaimetrickz/galaxy-zoo-2-images)

> Only a small sample is included in this repo for testing. Full dataset should be downloaded manually for full experiments.
